           <p> <b> Elizabeth Blackwell</b> was the first woman to gradute medical school, making her the first to open many doors for woman in the medical field. Blackwell earned her degree at 
               <a href="https://nyheritage.org/collections/geneva-medical-college-1834-1871">Geneva Medical College</a> in New York. </p>
               <br />
             <p>  Her medical degree journey began when a close friend, on their deathbed, mentioned to Elizabeth that they may have gotten better care if their doctor had been a woman. This inspired Elizabeth to become the first woman in America to graduate medical school. After graduating in 1849, she then became an advocate for female medical education and other career paths for woman. She published many books. Elizabeth was not always interested in the medical field. She actually started out her adulthood as a teacher, teaching grade school in both North and South Carolina. After the death of her before mentioned friend, she began teaching during the day and studying at night, taught by two physicans that happened to be family friends. Blackwell applied to many schools, and was rejected by all of them before finally being accepted to New York's Geneva College -  as a joke by the male students! They were shocked when from when she first came to class until she graduated top of her class.</p>
           
           <br /> 
           <p> After graduating medical school, Blackwell traveled to London to continue her studies. While studying the work of a midwife, Blackwell contracted "purulent opthalmia", making her blind in one eye and therefore forcing her to give of her dreams of being a surgeon.  </p>
           
           <br />
           
           <p> Though she faced many hardships throughout her life, Elizabeth Blackwell rose above her problems and found a way to be successful and help others. Her innovation in her field has inspired women for years. Even when Blackwell's health was deteriorating, she still worked hard and made strides for equality in medical careers. </p>
